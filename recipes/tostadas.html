    <p>
      Topped with a cross between a chunky guacamole and a tuna salad, these
      tostadas are a super satisfying, no-cook lunch or dinner for a steamy
      summer night when turning on the stove is a no-go. Instead of fresh tuna,
      this recipe employs the tinned variety, making these tostadas accessible
      for any budget. The simple serrano and lime dressing is tart and spicy
      with a hint of creaminess that balances the lean nature of canned tuna.
      Eat the salad like a dip with a bag of totopos at your desk, or pack it up
      with a bottle of wine and assemble your tostadas outside for a picnic in
      the park or day at the beach.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 medium garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
      <li>1 serrano chile, finely diced</li>
      <li>1 lime, juiced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>⅓ packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems</li>
      <li>1 large ripe Hass avocado</li>
      <li>½ small red onion</li>
      <li>1 medium tomato</li>
      <li>2 (5-ounce) cans tuna packed in oil, drained</li>
      <li>6 tostada shells</li>
      <li>Hot sauce, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dressing: In a medium bowl, mix together the garlic, serrano,
        lime juice, mayonnaise, ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper until well
        combined; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the salad: Roughly chop the cilantro, chop the avocado, dice the
        red onion and tomato, and place everything in the bowl with the
        dressing. Add the tuna and ¼ teaspoon salt and toss until combined.
        Taste and add more salt as desired. Serve immediately, or cover and
        refrigerate for up to two days.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are ready to eat, divide the filling among the tostada shells
        (about a generous ½ cup tuna salad for each tostada) and top with hot
        sauce, if desired.
