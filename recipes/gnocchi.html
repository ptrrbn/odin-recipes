    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 ounces baby spinach</li>
      <li>6 ounces Greek feta, crumbled (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
      <li>5tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>
        (16- to 17-ounce) package potato gnocchi (shelf-stable, fresh or frozen)
      </li>
      <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Big handful of chopped dill</li>
      <li>Big handful of chopped mint</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the spinach into a large bowl. Add half of the feta, juice of ½
        lemon, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a big pinch of salt; rub the
        ingredients vigorously into the spinach to tenderize it. Leave to sit
        and soften further while you cook the gnocchi.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large (about 12-inch) cast-iron or nonstick skillet over
        medium-high; add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the gnocchi to the pan,
        breaking up any that are stuck together. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes,
        tossing every 2 minutes, until golden and crispy all over. Allow to cool
        in the pan for 5 minutes; they will further crisp as they cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the gnocchi to the spinach, along with the red pepper, scallions,
        dill and mint. Drizzle with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, add the
        remaining crumbled feta and toss to combine. Squeeze the remaining lemon
        juice over top and serve.
