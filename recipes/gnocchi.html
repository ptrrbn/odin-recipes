    <h1>Crispy Gnocchi With Spinach and Feta</h1>

      <p>
        Inspired by the herbaceous and jaunty flavors of <em>spanakopita</em>,
        the savory, ever popular Greek pie, spinach and feta headline this
        textural gnocchi salad. The spinach is not cooked, but is simply
        massaged, which softens it while ensuring it maintains its leafy
        structure. Incorporating some feta to the spinach massage is a
        functional move — the salt in the feta helps to tenderize the leaves —
        but it also adds a hint of quiet luxury to this dish, as the leaves
        become coated with the creamy, briny cheese. Be heavy-handed with your
        herbs and lemon, as these bring boldness and freshness that play off the
        saltiness of the feta. Everyday shelf-stable gnocchi from your local
        supermarket is perfect for crisping in the pan; if you choose to use
        frozen variety, no defrosting is required.

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the spinach into a large bowl. Add half of the feta, juice of ½
          lemon, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a big pinch of salt; rub the
          ingredients vigorously into the spinach to tenderize it. Leave to sit
          and soften further while you cook the gnocchi.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a large (about 12-inch) cast-iron or nonstick skillet over
          medium-high; add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the gnocchi to the
          pan, breaking up any that are stuck together. Cook for 8 to 10
          minutes, tossing every 2 minutes, until golden and crispy all over.
          Allow to cool in the pan for 5 minutes; they will further crisp as
          they cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the gnocchi to the spinach, along with the red pepper, scallions,
          dill and mint. Drizzle with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, add the
          remaining crumbled feta and toss to combine. Squeeze the remaining
          lemon juice over top and serve.
